# Gene Expression Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict gene expression levels based on genomic features using a linear regression model. The model is trained on synthetic data generated to mimic real-world scenarios. The project includes data generation, model training, evaluation, and a user interface for making predictions based on input features.

## Introduction

Gene expression prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics and computational biology. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict gene expression levels from genomic features.

## Data Generation

Synthetic genomic features and gene expression levels are generated using numpy. The relationship between features and gene expression is defined by a set of true coefficients with added noise to simulate real-world data variability.

## Model Training and Evaluation

A linear regression model is trained on the synthetic dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric, and results are visualized with a scatter plot comparing predicted vs. actual gene expression levels.

## User Interaction

Users can input values for genomic features to predict gene expression levels using the trained model. The script prompts for user input and provides the predicted gene expression level along with an explanation of the result.
